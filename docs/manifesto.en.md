# TMCTOL Manifesto

> Bad Politics cannot kill Good Physics.

## The Trust Problem

After fifteen years of crypto, the core question is still open: **how do we build a resilient economy for long-term growth?**

We have seen DAOs vote themselves into collapse. Treasuries drained by a sequence of decisions. Liquidity disappearing with incentives. Price held up by belief—then broken when belief fades.

The problem is not people. The problem is architecture where system survival depends on political cycles.

**TMCTOL (Token Minting Curve + Treasury-Owned Liquidity) offers a different approach.**

## The Architecture of Resilience

We separate DAO architecture into three layers with distinct areas of responsibility:

**L0:** `Physics` — invariants and risk boundaries.
**L1:** `Strategy` — growth directions and capital distribution.
**L2:** `Tactics` — execution through teams, agents, and DAO loops.

**Physics protects Strategy from strategic error. Strategy sets direction and funds Tactics from the primary L1 liquidity source. Tactics execute.**

### Physics

The protocol manages its own liquidity through treasury-owned market depth. A bidirectional price corridor compresses over time: burning lowers the ceiling, TOL accumulation raises the floor. At elasticity inversion, issuance becomes a floor-strengthening mechanism rather than pure dilution.

> Fundamental rules do not change through ordinary governance voting. Changing them requires an explicit, auditable protocol upgrade path.

### Strategy

Strategy is formed by the `L1 TMCTOL DAO`: at this layer, the community sets expansion priorities — what to fund, which directions to reinforce, and which initiatives to scale.

> Strategy sets the growth trajectory and allocates capital, but it does not break the foundation.

### Tactics

Execution happens through `L2 TOL DAOs` — autonomous units operating within the boundaries of Physics and in the direction set by Strategy. Each defines its own rules: how contribution is evaluated, how rewards are distributed, and how decisions are made. Compensation systems for humans and/or AI agents, game economies, marketing campaigns, grant programs... different domains, the same structural guarantee.

> No allocation for status. Reward for proven value.

## Principles

| Principle                            | Meaning                                  |
| :----------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| **Resilience over hype**             | The system must survive market cycles    |
| **Invariants over manual control**   | Code constrains catastrophic paths       |
| **Coordination over politicization** | Governance sets direction, not paralysis |
| **Outcomes over status**             | Contribution is rewarded, not rhetoric   |
| **Transparency over trust**          | Core rules must be verifiable            |

## The Promise

**We do not guarantee profit. We guarantee boundaries of risk and responsibility.**

TMCTOL manifests a DAO form where:

1. Survival is rooted in system physics.
2. Growth is directed by community strategy.
3. Execution is rewarded by results.

> Governance is not about endlessly rewriting survival rules. Governance is about direction and accountability.

## Call

Any DAO can be evaluated with three questions:

1. Where is the boundary between politics and invariants?
2. How does the system survive errors and conflict?
3. Is real contribution rewarded?

Join the coordination. Verify the code. Verify the math in the [TMCTOL specification](https://github.com/llblab/tmctol/blob/main/docs/tmctol.en.md).

> Build a resilient form of collective governance with us.
